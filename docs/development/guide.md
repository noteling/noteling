# Noteling developer guide

Build, configuration and implementation reference. For installation and everyday
use, start with the [user README](../../README.md).

A quiet macOS helper for non-technical people in companies full of internal tools. A familiar knows your world
and acts on your behalf: point the pen at anything on screen and it explains what you are looking at; ask it to
do something and it takes the mouse. It sits as a small floating sticky-note character whose eyes follow your
mouse, and it uses the company's own notes and scripts for the tool you are in.

## How it works
1. **Watcher** (Accessibility, no screenshots) polls the frontmost app, window title and browser URL.
2. **Tool packs** in `~/.noteling/tools/<pack>/` match the current app/URL and supply docs plus scripts.
3. **Pen**: hold the note until the ring fills, or press **⌃⌥Space**. The pointer becomes a quill, the screen dims with a
   shimmering border, the element under the quill is outlined, and a click picks it: a screenshot (ringed at the click)
   plus a zoomed crop. **Drag** to circle something instead: the ink stroke goes on the screenshot, the crop is the circled
   area, and the labelled controls inside it are named for the model.
   A pick says what, not what about it, so the pad asks first and nothing goes to Claude yet: the pick lands as a note
   with "What about it?", the pad's input takes the keyboard, and up to three questions sit under it as tabs (the
   active pack's `pen:` list, else "What is this?", "Why is it like this?", "What can I do here?"). A tap, your own
   words, or Return on its own (the short identify-and-explain) sends one request with the question; Esc or **Never
   mind** puts the pick away, and a new pick replaces one still waiting. The screen, the notes' checks and the page's
   brief start at the pick, so they're ready by the time you ask. A sticker pick asks about its note at once.
4. **Notes**: while the pen is up, **right-click** (two-finger click, or ⌃-click) a control and a sticky note opens right on it.
   Type, ⏎ keeps it, ⇧⏎ makes a new line, Esc drops it; tick **Warning** for the orange kind. Right-drag circles a spot and
   sticks the note to that area. Right-click an existing sticker to edit or remove it. Picking up the pen shows every note
   already left on the current screen as a small sticker on its control (hover to read the whole thing); a pick puts the
   notes on that control onto the pad first, and Claude gets them too ("Notes left on this control"). Typed questions see the
   notes on the current screen as well. Notes live in `~/.noteling/notes/`, one JSON file each (notes kept in a pack's
   `notes.json` by earlier versions are moved there once, and the file renamed `notes.json.moved`). A note made in a
   browser is stuck to its page by its page key (so a record is the same page however it was reached, and a site that
   serves every page from one path keeps them apart), and to its control by the page's own id first, then its role and
   label, or a rectangle relative to the window for circled spots; in other apps, by app and window. Nothing is stuck
   to a password field. Nothing about notes stays on screen: arriving where there are notes, the bubble holds up a
   sticky with how many for a moment (hover it to read them). Press ⌥ Option twice (or click that sticky) to show them
   open on the page, in an overlay that lets clicks through; press it again, click, scroll, type or change page and
   they go. Where there are none, a one-line hint says so. A note whose control isn't on screen is left off rather
   than placed wrong; up to three show down the window's right edge instead, saying what they are for. The shortcut
   can be turned off in Settings. Pointing with the pen tells the notes on that control first (each as "PEOPLE SAY ·
   who · confirmed when", flagged when no one has confirmed it in 90 days), then the page's notes for controls not on
   screen, before the answer. A note can be linked to a script from the packs for its page ("Check with…" in the note
   editor, for scripts that take no arguments); pointing at it, or clicking its sticker, runs the script as you, stopped
   at 10 seconds, and shows its own answer as a CHECKED line under the note. A check runs only a script from a pack for
   that page, with only the arguments the script declares. Clicking a sticker with the pen asks about that note;
   right-clicking it edits it. The model is told notes are named people's claims with their age, to attribute and
   not to state as fact. How notes get used is counted in `~/.noteling/usage/notes.jsonl`: counts, kinds and note ids,
   never words or addresses.
5. **Chat**: double-click the note and type, for questions that have no single thing to point at. A single click just pokes it. The note reacts as it goes:
   curious when you hover, thinking while it works, happy or sad when the answer lands.
   The chat is a pad of sticky notes: each question is a note with the answer written on it (inked in line by line as it
   arrives), follow-ups are paper tabs under the note, and the character peeks over the newest one.
   **The capture moment:** a question about the screen (and every pen pick) takes the screen when it is asked, with a
   flash and the picture shrinking toward the pad (`CaptureFlash`; a fade with Reduce Motion). The answer holds that
   screen (`FrozenScreen`): `look_at_screen` returns it and `read_screen` the window that was in front, so the person can
   switch away; a read after they've moved on says so rather than reading the wrong window. An answer that controls the
   computer in the foreground looks live instead. A chip under the question (`SeenScreen`) says what Claude was shown,
   and clicking it shows exactly that.
   For a little paper adventure, right-click the note → **Fold into a crane** (also in the pad's More menu and menu bar).
   It folds, flaps around the current screen once, lands at the same spot, and unfolds. The flight is click-through;
   **Esc** or menu bar → **Land Noteling** brings it back early. Starting work brings it back too. Available while idle;
   with macOS Reduce Motion enabled, the fold and gentle flap stay at home.
6. Claude can call the pack's scripts, `read_file` / `grep` over the docs, and `read_screen` (accessibility text).
   General chat also knows the saved sources (the jobs taught with Watch Me or created in chat).
   - **Context:** every turn carries a short "Your saved jobs" list: name, kind, address, reading rules, and when each was taught and last run.
   - **Tools** (`SourceConversation`): `get_source` shows one job with its latest findings, `update_source` edits it through the same store and checks as Edit on its page in Jobs, `remove_source` / `restore_source` take it out of future runs and bring it back, `create_source` starts a job that reads through a pack script, with no teaching, and `offer_run_source` adds a Run now tab, which runs the job and opens its page in Jobs.
   - **Rules:** only the person's tap runs a job. Edits wait while a read is running, and they never clear a source's "needs review" flag. Each change leaves a receipt on the pad and an Open Jobs tab.
7. **Control** (off by default, Settings → "Allow Noteling to control the mouse and keyboard"): ask it to do something
   ("type the sum formula for me") and it does it through Claude's computer toolset. By default it works **in the
   background**: it drives the window you were in when you asked through Accessibility and events sent to that app, so
   your mouse and keyboard stay yours and you can carry on elsewhere. A purple ghost cursor shows what it presses.
   Once desktop execution begins, the instruction moves from chat to a compact **background task screen** in the top-right.
   Expand it for a live window preview, approvals and the result; **Stop** or ⌃⌥Space ends the work. Collapsing or hiding
   the task screen keeps execution running, and completion respects that choice. Reopen it through the menu bar's
   **Background Tasks…** entry or by clicking Noteling while a task runs. The task header can be dragged to another spot.
   Recent results and their last screenshots are kept for up to 20 tasks until Noteling quits. Ordinary conversational
   answers stay in chat. One desktop task runs at a time. Chat waits for its current request to finish; Morning Files can
   hand off several actions to a saved queue, which runs them one at a time.
   Background `read_screen` and `look_at_screen` read only the selected target window and fail if no target is available.
   When something needs the real mouse (a drag, a context menu, a ⌘ shortcut) it asks on the task screen first.
   Without the separate display, this explicitly asks to use your screen, mouse and keyboard, and **Go ahead** begins
   the desktop handoff with a shimmer border. Pause your own input during that step; typing (including ⌘Tab), clicking,
   scrolling or moving the cursor takes control back.
   The hand icon on the pad, next to the
   eye, turns background mode off; then it takes the mouse as before (the shimmer border, a caption per step, moving the
   mouse or pressing Esc stops it). Background Send / Submit / Delete / Pay button presses pause for a one-action approval
   on the task screen; a changed window or control invalidates that approval. A pack can list more
   controls to confirm under `irreversible:` in its SKILL.md. `find_on_screen` gives it labelled controls via Accessibility;
   in the background it presses them by id with `click_element`.
   Chat composers that send with Return can use `send_message`: the task screen shows the recipient, observed
   app/window/composer context and complete typed draft for one-action approval. Noteling rechecks the focused
   composer and exact draft, then presses Return once. Input permission is separate and must still be active for
   a separate-display send. Unreadable or changed drafts are not sent; uncertain delivery is inspected without
   automatically retrying. The offscreen input runner still rejects raw Return; send approval is handled by this dedicated tool.

   **Separate display (experimental, off by default):** Settings → "Use a separate display for background tasks"
   lets Noteling move the selected task window onto a temporary virtual monitor when the first action begins.
   The task card stays on your physical screen. If background input needs help, approving the mouse-and-keyboard
   request keeps the task window on its separate display. Noteling borrows input for each short action and returns
   it between steps, before the model thinks or inspects another screenshot. Typing or mouse input interrupts a
   borrowed action. Stop, completion and quitting return borrowed windows. Opening the live preview returns the window and stops
   the background task. Read-only questions never create a display or move a window.
   This uses private macOS display APIs. Input borrowing is in `Sources/Familiar/Native/Control/Background/OffscreenInputBorrow.swift`;
   see [its scope and verification status](../architecture/offscreen-input-borrow.md).
   It keeps existing app logins and uses native Accessibility/process-event controls, with temporary input borrowing
   when approved. It does not create a separate desktop session or guarantee every app's text input. Full-screen windows and mirrored-display
   arrangements are not supported by this first version; setup failures stop before task input.

8. **Watch me**: menu bar → **Watch Me** (or the eye on the pad). Do the task the way you normally do, then press ⌃⌥Space or
   **Stop Watching**. Noteling records clicks (with the real labels of what you clicked, via Accessibility), a crop around each
   click, a full frame whenever the screen changes, and text typed into named form fields, into
   `~/.noteling/recordings/<stamp>/` (folder 0700, files 0600). After stopping, enter a short name or description, then
   optionally add context such as reading rules, exceptions or where to stop. **Skip context** continues without it.
   Noteling waits for both steps before generating one draft from the recording and your inputs, then puts a compact
   review on the pad, including the source's reading rules and any uncertainty notice. Retry preserves both inputs. Typing while a draft is under review revises it: the text joins the recording's context as "Changes requested after reviewing the draft", and the draft is written again from the same recording. Earlier requests still apply, and a failed draft can be revised the same way.
   **Open full draft** shows the complete steps, screens, glossary, caveats and source details in a separate, read-only
   text window with search and copy. Long documents stay out of the chat layout. **Keep it** saves the complete draft as a tool pack (`SKILL.md`,
   `docs/screens.md`, `docs/workflows/<task>.md`, `docs/glossary.md`) into `~/.noteling/tools/<site>/` without touching
   existing files (new workflows get `-2`, `-3`; screens are added only when new); **Discard** throws the draft away. Either
   way the recording folder is deleted, as it is when you clear the pad or quit; anything left behind by a crash is swept
   after 7 days. The pen and control are off while it watches.
   What is never written down: anything typed in a password field or a field named like one (password, PIN, OTP, token, key…),
   anything typed in a terminal (Terminal, iTerm2, Warp, kitty, Alacritty, WezTerm, Ghostty…), anything typed outside a form
   field (editors, chat composers), and anything typed when Accessibility cannot say which field has focus — the log then
   says only that something was typed. A click never stores the value of a secure field, a text area or a terminal. Without
   Accessibility, keystrokes are not listened for at all. The write-up sends at most `watchMaxImages` images and 20 MB.
   Headless: `--record-synthetic <dir>` (a fake recording from the current screen) and
   `--summarize-recording <dir> ["purpose"] [--tools-root <dir>] [--keep] [--claude-cli]` (prints the draft JSON; keeps into a temp folder by default).

9. **Morning Files**: a small folder in the upper-left opens categorized folders and a spread of files. Choose any file
   to see its three parts: what it is, what it means for you, and one to three options, best first (hover an option for its
   exact instruction). **Show original** shows what Noteling read. **Ignore** files it away, **I'll do it**
   keeps it yours, and handing it to Noteling saves the action before the file flies to the background task screen.
   Drag the small folder itself or a window's header to move it; the morning windows and background task list remember
   their positions. Add your own folders and files, and configure roles, relationships and identities through
   **… → Who's Who**. The retrieval menu
   brings back filed items and completed results. Everything is stored privately under `~/.noteling/morning/`.
   **Try sample files** adds explicitly fictional examples; these can only prepare local drafts and analysis.
   Preparation uses your configured Claude connection with no tools. **Work in an app** uses existing desktop control
   and approvals. Queue entries survive restarts; interrupted work returns for review rather than replaying actions.
   **Jobs** (see below) lists everything Noteling runs: the saved sources, which read a calendar, inbox or web view
   (reading jobs), and the watches, which check items (see Watch lists). **Jobs → Teach a job with Watch Me** teaches a
   calendar, inbox, or web view from a demonstration.
   Show the location, account, and information to read; explain what they mean and review the learned description in chat.
   **Keep it** registers a reading source in Jobs. If no reading source was established, Noteling keeps the review
   open and explains what is missing. Ordinary Watch Me action workflows remain separate from source collection.
   Previously saved demonstrations appear under **Saved demonstrations → Review & add** in Jobs so you can confirm their
   source address and reading scope without recording again. A calendar job reads today with **Run now**; for another
   day, choose **Read another day…** on its page, pick a day and hours, and **Read calendar**.
   Each reading job's page has **Edit** (or **Review**) and **Remove…**. Edit its description, location, account and
   reading rules; changes update the same source. Remove excludes it from future batches while keeping past run results.
   **Removed jobs → Restore** in Jobs (or **Undo** right after removing it) brings the saved setup back, including after a restart.
   Noteling uses fresh observations to collect that date and compute meeting blocks, accepted conflicts, and open time
   within your selected briefing window. Partial reads show their limitations and do not assert free time.
   **Run all reading jobs** reads registered sources one at a time: calendars for today (09:00–17:00 briefing window in each
   source’s time zone), and mail/web sources within their saved scope. It collects up to 25 visible mail/web observations,
   retaining evidence and coverage gaps. New-item inbox discovery uses visible rows and snippets. Separately,
   unresolved cards can request bounded rechecks of their tracked conversations, including opening a matching thread.
   A job can instead read through a pack script that its SKILL.md lists under `sources:`, with no window, model or
   computer control. The bundled `imap-mail` pack's `today` reads everything that arrived in the inbox over IMAP,
   read-only, back to the last read a card step sorted (24 hours the first time, at most 7 days, the newest 200
   messages). Chat creates such a job with `create_source`; the job's reading rules are applied by the card step.
   Results show which reads completed, were partial, or failed. Stop cancels the remaining reads
   and keeps collections already saved. **Run all reading jobs** opens the **Latest run** screen, which follows the run and
   names any job that didn't finish at the top. The card controls (**Make cards from saved results**, **View cards**)
   are on the run screens; the main screen shows card work only while it runs or when it fails.
   Clicking a completed row opens that run’s findings; a run's **Open job** opens the job's page, for its setup and rules.
   **Run history** keeps earlier results available after a restart. Findings appear before expandable collection
   details, and partial or failed reads remain clearly labeled.
   Each run is stored under `~/.noteling/runs/<readable-timestamp>/`, with `run.json`, per-source JSON
   exports, and a readable `report.md`. **Show run folder** opens the run folder. Existing saved collections
   are preserved as recovered results; future runs retain every collection instead of replacing previous ones.
   This first calendar collection supports exposed Accessibility navigation controls; unsupported controls are reported.
   Calendar collection does not create or move meetings. Reads are started explicitly; scheduled collection, preference
   history and relationship-based recommendations are not connected yet. Apart from script jobs, sources are read from the screen.

   **Jobs** (`MorningNavigation.Route.jobs`, `Features/Jobs/`) is one page for both kinds, opened from the Jobs box on
   the panel's home ("5 jobs · 2 need attention · last run 6:31 PM"), the panel's **⋯** menu, the menu bar's **Jobs…**,
   and the chat's **Open Jobs** tab. Storage and runners stay each kind's own: `CalendarStore` and
   `CalendarCollectionRunner` for reading jobs, `WatchListStore` and `WatchListRunner` for watches.
   - The list (`JobsPage`) has every reading job, calendars included, and every watch, the person's own and the team's.
     Jobs that need attention come first (a failed, partial or skipped read; one that needs review, can't run yet or
     needs something in Settings, such as a pack's secret or mouse and keyboard control for a job that reads from the
     screen; a watch whose items aren't as expected or couldn't be checked, or whose files can't be read), then the
     person's own, then the team's, each by name. A row says what the job does ("Reads mail", "Checks 3 items · from
     your team's tools"), how often it runs ("Every 15 minutes", "When you run it", with a watch's start or end), how its
     last run went ("Last run 6:31 PM · 12 new · 3 cards", "2 of 8 not as expected · 1 couldn't check", "nothing
     saved") and how it stands (Running, Waiting to run, Paused, Off, Needs Settings, Needs review, Can't run yet,
     Failed), with what's wrong in red. Its buttons: **Run now** (a reading job's read, a calendar's today; a watch's
     check), **Stop** while a reading job reads, **Open Settings** when it needs something there, and **Pause**/**Resume**
     for a watch of the person's own or the on/off switch for a team job. A watch's file notes stay on its row. The
     page also has **Run all reading jobs** with **Stop all**, **Latest run** (saying when a job didn't finish) and **Run
     history**; folders in the watches folders that aren't jobs, and why; **Saved demonstrations** to review and add;
     **Removed jobs** to restore; **Teach a job with Watch Me**; and how to start watching items in chat.
   - Every job's page starts with the same header (`JobHeader`): its name, what it does and how often, its last run,
     how it stands, its buttons, and **Card**, which opens the card it made: a watch's card from
     `cards/inbox/watch-…/job.json`, resolved or not, or a reading job's open cards (a menu when there are several, those
     its latest run made or saw first). A reading job's page (`SourceJobPage`, `.sourceJob(id)`) then has its meaning,
     account and reading rules, **Edit**/**Review**, **Remove…**, **Read another day…** for a calendar, **Run history**,
     and its latest run's findings, with **Open the run**, "Became a card" and **Matters to me**. A watch's page is
     `.watch(id)` (see Watch lists).
   - Back from a job's page goes to Jobs, and from Jobs to the home; a card or a run opened from a job's page comes back
     to it. The older Manage sources (`.sources`) and Watches (`.watches`, which shows Jobs) routes still work, but
     nothing the person sees leads there.
   Saved observations generate continuing cards. Repeated scans match cards using the source and an extracted item key;
   newer evidence can update or resolve a card, while missing items remain open. Human edits and handled decisions persist.
   The card step judges each item once: only items that are new or changed since its last judgment go to the model.
   While a job reads mail through a script, the one-week attention test adds thumbs and **Let me explain…** to its
   cards, a daily line that opens the day's rest (with **Matters to me**), and **This week**. Its append-only
   ledger stays in `~/.noteling/attention/` and is never sent to a model. Thumbs, explanations and **Matters to me**
   (also offered on each run result that didn't become a card) become lessons in `morning/`, listed on **What you've
   taught**; the card step sends each job's 40 newest lessons beside its rules.
   **Discuss or adjust** opens a focused card conversation; an explicit handoff queues its action for the shared executor.
   Cards, decisions and accepted work live in a local SQLite database, separate from source rules and run evidence.
   See [persistent cards](../architecture/persistent-cards.md) for identity and recheck limitations.
   See [calendar collection](../architecture/calendar-ingestion.md) and [Morning Files](../architecture/morning-files.md).

Noteling appears in the Dock with its app icon. Click it to reopen chat, use **Quit Noteling** or ⌘Q to exit,
or use macOS **Force Quit** (⌥⌘Esc) if it becomes unresponsive. Closing a window keeps Noteling running.

## Try it on another Mac (5 minutes)
```bash
xcode-select --install                      # Command Line Tools, if `swift --version` fails
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # uv, gets bundled into the app for pack scripts
git clone https://github.com/noteling/noteling.git && cd noteling
./scripts/make-dev-cert.sh                  # local signing identity so permission grants survive rebuilds
./scripts/run.sh                            # builds build/Noteling.app and launches it
```
Then, once:
1. macOS asks for **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording**. Grant both (System Settings → Privacy & Security), then quit and relaunch Noteling from the menu bar.
2. Right-click the note → **Settings…** → choose **API key** and paste an Anthropic API key, or choose **Local Claude CLI** to use your installed, signed-in Claude Code → **Save**.
3. Menu bar → **Watch Me**, do a short task in the app you want it to learn, then **Stop Watching** (or ⌃⌥Space). Add a short description, then add optional context or choose **Skip context**. Review the draft and choose **Keep it**. It becomes a tool pack under `~/.noteling/tools/`.

No packs are needed to start: watching creates them. Chat, recording write-ups, and delegated actions send their selected
context to your configured Claude connection. Creating and editing Morning Files or Who’s Who entries stays local.

## Requirements
- macOS 14+, Xcode Command Line Tools (Swift 5.9+). No Xcode needed.
- `uv` on the build machine (gets bundled into the app; scripts declare deps inline, PEP 723).
- An Anthropic API key (or a gateway that speaks the Messages API), or an installed Claude Code CLI with its own login.

## Build and run
```bash
./scripts/make-dev-cert.sh                # once: local signing identity so permission grants survive rebuilds
./scripts/run.sh                          # builds build/Noteling.app and launches it
./scripts/test.sh                         # deterministic tests; current Swift tools, no API/login needed
.build/release/Familiar --selftest tools  # loads the packs, runs three scripts, no UI, no API
.build/release/Familiar --render-mascot /tmp/mascot [--style innocent|innocentV1|innocentV3|innocentV4|sharp]   # renders every mood, the quill cursor and the app-icon source as PNGs
.build/release/Familiar --render-origami /tmp/origami [--style innocentV4]   # folding stages and crane wing poses as PNGs
.build/release/Familiar --render-card /tmp/card [--states]   # the pad with a pick, a note sticker and answers, as PNGs
.build/release/Familiar --render-background-task /tmp/tasks # task screen states, fabricated content, no model or desktop capture
.build/release/Familiar --render-morning /tmp/morning      # native folder, files, people and queue with fictional local data
.build/release/Familiar --render-pen /tmp/pen               # the pen overlay over a fake page: stickers and the note editor, as a PNG
build/Noteling.app/Contents/MacOS/Noteling --ask "question" [url] [--shot] [--control] [--claude-cli]   # headless Claude call, real tool loop
```
First launch creates `~/.noteling/` (or `$NOTELING_HOME`) with `config.json`, `tools/` (example packs copied in) and `noteling.log`. If you used the app before it was renamed, an existing `~/.familiar` is moved there on first launch, and `$FAMILIAR_HOME` still works.
Right-click the bubble → **Settings…** to choose the Claude connection, enter pack secrets, and set the hotkey, hold time and start-at-login.
Secrets never go into `config.json`: dev builds keep them owner-only in `~/.noteling/secrets.json` (a self-signed app is re-identified by macOS on every rebuild, so the Keychain would prompt each time); set `secretsStore` to `keychain` for Developer ID builds.

### Use your Claude Code login
The API connection remains the default, including for existing configurations. To use the local CLI:
1. Install Claude Code and sign in through its normal flow (`claude auth login` in Terminal).
2. In Noteling **Settings… → Connection**, choose **Local Claude CLI**. Leave the executable path blank to find it automatically, or enter its full path. Leave the model blank to use Claude Code's default.
3. Click **Check connection** to check installation and login status, then **Save**.

Noteling runs the unmodified Claude Code executable using its own login; no additional API key is needed for this mode. Requests share your Claude Code usage allowance, including your existing subscription allowance when signed in through a Claude plan. Switching connections preserves your API credentials and gateway settings.

For a single headless run, append `--claude-cli` to `--ask` or `--summarize-recording`; this override does not change your saved connection. Tool packs, screen access and optional mouse/keyboard control run through Noteling's tools. Claude Code's own filesystem and shell tools are disabled. Private temporary bridge data is removed after each turn, and CLI sessions are not persisted.

## Permissions
The menu bar menu shows permission status and opens the relevant System Settings pane.
- **Accessibility**: watcher context, element under the wand, `read_screen`.
- **Screen Recording**: the screenshot when you ask. Relaunch after granting.

## Tool packs
```
~/.noteling/tools/
  expenses/
    SKILL.md            manifest: name, description, match rules, short overview
    docs/               any files, any structure (md/txt are stuffed or indexed)
    scripts/
      report_status.py  def run(report_id: str) -> dict   -> tool "expenses__report_status"
  shared/               a pack with no match rules is always active
    scripts/open_url.py, copy_to_clipboard.py, fetch_page.py
```
`SKILL.md` front matter:
```yaml
---
name: Expenses (Concur)
description: Expense reports, receipts, cost centers, approvals.
match:
  urls: [expenses.internal.example.com, /concur.*reports/]   # substring, or /regex/
  bundles: [com.example.SomeApp]
  titles: [Concur]
---
Free-form overview that is always included when the pack is active.
```
Two optional keys name scripts by file name (without `.py`):
- `brief: <script>`: run as soon as a page the pack matches comes to the front, with no arguments (the script reads
  the page from `NOTELING_CONTEXT`). Its result is kept for two minutes per page address and sent with the pen's request
  and with typed questions on that page as "What the page's tools say", so the answer needs no tool round trips. The
  pen waits up to 10 seconds for a run in progress; a failed run is kept for 30 seconds and the answer says what
  couldn't be checked. A pack whose body says how to answer a pen pick gets its own shape instead of the default one.
- `watch: <script>`: the check a watch list runs for each item (see Watch list).

And one that is a list of words, not a script:
- `pen: [Why this price?, What should I do?]`: the questions the pen offers as taps after a pick on the pack's pages,
  up to three, in place of the general ones.

Scripts: a top-level `run(...)` with type hints and a docstring becomes a tool; the docstring's `Args:` section
becomes parameter descriptions; the return value is JSON-serialised back to the model. Dependencies go in a
PEP 723 header and are installed by the bundled `uv` on first use:
```python
# /// script
# dependencies = ["requests>=2.31"]
# ///
```
Scripts receive `NOTELING_CONTEXT` (JSON of app/window/url) and `NOTELING_TOOL_DIR` in the environment (also as `FAMILIAR_CONTEXT` and `FAMILIAR_TOOL_DIR`, for packs written before the rename), plus the
config's `env` map and, for each name the pack lists under `requires:` in its front matter, the secret of that name from
the Keychain (entered in Settings). The menu bar shows which packs are missing a secret.
Behind a company proxy, scripts and uv also get the Mac's network settings (`ScriptNetwork`): `HTTP(S)_PROXY` and
`NO_PROXY` from System Settings' fixed proxies, or from its proxy auto-config file resolved once at launch for an
internet address; `SSL_CERT_FILE` (and `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`) pointing at `~/.noteling/run/certificates.pem`, the
certificates this Mac trusts for everyone, including one a company installs for its proxy; and `UV_NATIVE_TLS=1`.
The config's `env` map wins over all of them, for example to send internal hosts direct with `NO_PROXY`.
Every script also gets `NOTELING_CARDS_DIR`, a folder of its own in the cards inbox, where writing a file makes a card in
Morning Files (see The cards inbox).
Docs under the stuff limit are pasted into the prompt; larger ones are listed and read on demand.

### The Waxwing pack (current target)
`tools/waxwing/` explains the Waxwing App (127.0.0.1:4310). Its scripts talk to the app's API, which needs a read
token: in Waxwing open **Account and access → Create agent token (Read)**, then paste it in Noteling Settings as
`WAXWING_API_TOKEN` (the pack declares `requires: [WAXWING_API_TOKEN]`). `whats_here` resolves the current browser URL to the real page,
collection, model revision, record or work report; `search`, `library` and `attention` cover the rest.
The docs were generated from the app's repo and use its real button labels.

### Team tools from GitHub (linked tools)
Someone who supports a group can keep its tool packs in one GitHub repository (github.com or GitHub Enterprise), shaped
like the tools folder: each top-level folder is a pack (`<pack>/SKILL.md`, `docs/**`, `scripts/*.py`). Each person links
it once in **Settings → Team tools from GitHub** with the repository's address and a token, and Noteling keeps a copy
current by itself, without git (`Sources/Familiar/ToolPacks/LinkedTools.swift`).
- **Settings.** The address goes to `toolsRepo` in config.json, as the plain web address: an SSH address
  (`git@github.example.com:acme/tools.git`), `.git`, a browser address such as `/tree/main`, and any name and password
  in it are reduced to `https://github.example.com/acme/tools`. `toolsRepoBranch` (default `main`) is set in config.json
  only. The token is the secret `NOTELING_TOOLS_REPO_TOKEN` (Keychain in signed builds, `secrets.json` in dev builds);
  it is never written to config.json or the log, and a pack can't get it through `requires:`. A public repository
  needs no token. The API is `https://api.github.com` for github.com, `https://api.<host>` for `*.ghe.com`, and
  `https://<host>/api/v3` for a GitHub Enterprise Server.
- **Checks.** At launch (after the first tools load), every 10 minutes, on **Update now**, and right after Settings saves
  a changed address, token or branch, Noteling asks `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{branch}` with
  `Accept: application/vnd.github.sha`: the commit id, as plain text. Only when it differs from the installed one does it
  download `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/tarball/{sha}`, which GitHub redirects to its download host. The token goes on
  a redirect only to the repository's host and its subdomains. One check runs at a time. Requests use the Mac's proxy
  settings and trusted certificates, with no cache.
- **Install.** The archive is unpacked with `/usr/bin/tar` into `~/.noteling/.linked-tools-incoming` (bsdtar refuses
  `..` paths and writing through links; no `-P`), must hold exactly one top folder (`owner-repo-sha/`), loses any
  symbolic link that leads outside it, and is swapped in for `~/.noteling/linked-tools/` with a single
  `renamex_np(RENAME_SWAP)`. If anything fails, the copy that worked stays as it was. `~/.noteling/linked-tools.json`
  (owner-only) records `url`, `branch`, `sha`, `updatedAt`, `lastCheckedAt` and `lastError`; `linked-tools/` is
  owner-only too. Clearing the address and saving removes both.
- **Status.** Settings shows `acme/tools · abc1234 · updated 3 min ago`, or what went wrong in plain words while the old
  copy keeps working (`Couldn't update. … Using the copy from 10:42.`). The menu's Tools line says how many packs came
  from the link, or that team tools were not updated.
- **Precedence.** `ToolRegistry` loads your own folder first, then `linkedRoot`. A pack of your own with the same folder
  name wins, and the log says `tools: your own <pack> is used instead of the linked one`; Settings lists them too. This
  is how to try a fix before pushing it: copy the pack into your own tools folder, change it, **Reload**, push, then
  delete your copy. The examples Noteling puts in a new tools folder count as your own (`expenses`, `hr-portal`,
  `imap-mail`, `it-access`, `shared`, `waxwing`), so give team packs names of their own.
- **Read only.** Nothing writes into `linked-tools/`: each update replaces it. Notes the pen leaves go to the notes store;
  a team pack's `notes.json` is taken into it after each update and never renamed, and a team note you edit or remove
  is changed only in your notes. A Watch Me draft or a new pack for a note whose folder name only the team has goes to
  `<name>-mine` in your own folder, so it doesn't hide theirs. `read_file` and `grep` read a pack's files from
  the folder its pack is loaded from, and never outside it. Scripts run as they do from your own folder;
  `NOTELING_TOOL_DIR` points into the copy, which each update replaces, so a script should keep state elsewhere.

### Setup files (`.notelingsetup`)
Whoever supports a group can hand out one file instead of explaining Settings: double-clicking it (or **Settings → Team
tools from GitHub → Import setup file…**) links the team's tools and saves the secrets they need
(`Sources/Familiar/Configuration/NotelingSetup.swift`).
```json
{"noteling_setup": 1, "name": "Holiday pilot",
 "tools_repo": {"url": "https://github.example.com/team/tools", "token": "github_pat_…", "branch": "main"},
 "secrets": {"SHOP_API_KEY": "…"}}
```
- It can set only the team tools' address, token and branch, and secrets for tool packs. Anything else in the file is
  listed as not used and never applied; the Claude connection comes from the team's `noteling.json` as for anyone
  linked by hand. The repository's token goes under `tools_repo`, never among the secrets.
- Noteling first says what it will do (the repository, whether it replaces the team tools linked now, the names of the
  secrets, never their values) and applies it only on **Set up**. Then it checks the repository right away and says how
  it went: what is linked, how many tool packs and team jobs came with it, with **Open Jobs**; or why it isn't linked
  yet, while the setup stays saved and the usual 10-minute checks keep trying.
- The type is registered by the app (`app.noteling.setup`, extension `notelingsetup`, in `Info.plist`), so Finder opens
  such files with Noteling. A file over 64 KB, without `"noteling_setup": 1`, from a newer version, or that sets nothing
  is refused with the reason. Noteling doesn't keep the file: the token and secrets go to the Keychain (the secrets file
  in dev builds), and the file can be deleted afterwards. Anyone with the file can read the token in it, so give it a
  read-only token for that one repository, and share it only inside the team.

### Team settings (`noteling.json`)
A team that reaches Claude through its own gateway can set the connection for everyone who links its tools, so nobody
hands config files around. `noteling.json` at the root of the linked repository (a reserved name there; it is not a
pack) is read at launch and after each new copy (`Sources/Familiar/Configuration/TeamSettings.swift`):
```json
{"claude": {"baseURL": "https://llm-gateway.example.com",
            "headers": {"X-Consumer-Id": "abc", "X-Api-Key": "$GATEWAY_KEY"},
            "model": "claude-opus-5", "effort": "medium"}}
```
- **Keys.** Only `claude.baseURL`, `claude.headers`, `claude.model` and `claude.effort`. Anything else is ignored, and
  Settings lists it. A field left out, `null` or empty stays each person's own. `baseURL` starts with `https://`
  (`http://` only for localhost) and has no `?` or `#`. Noteling adds `/v1/messages` to it, as Anthropic's SDKs do, so
  leave `/v1` off (Settings warns about it). `effort` is `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` or `max`. `model` applies to the
  local Claude CLI too.
- **Precedence.** While the tools are linked, the file wins over each person's own settings for exactly the fields it
  sets: `Config.applying(_:)` makes the configuration in effect. A `baseURL` also means the API connection, even for
  someone who chose the local Claude CLI. That gateway gets only the team's headers: not the person's own headers, and
  not their Anthropic key unless a header asks for it (`$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). The team's values are never written into
  config.json (`Config.save` refuses a configuration in effect), so unlinking, or removing the file, brings everyone's
  own values back. Every Claude client is built from the configuration in effect: chat, Watch Me write-ups, source
  reads, cards and queued tasks, and the `--ask` and `--summarize-recording` commands. When an update changes the file,
  chat reconnects the way saving Settings does, keeping the conversation.
- **Secrets.** A header value written exactly `$NAME` is the secret of that name, read when the client is built (the
  Keychain in signed builds, `secrets.json` in dev builds). `$$` at the start stands for a literal `$`. Names are letters,
  digits and `_`, like pack secrets, and `$NOTELING_TOOLS_REPO_TOKEN` is never sent. Settings shows a field for each name
  under Tool packs ("used by your team's Claude settings"). While one is missing there is no connection, and chat says
  which. The same works in your own `apiHeaders`. Log lines name headers, never their values.
- **Safety.** A file that isn't valid JSON, or has a value of the wrong type or an unknown effort, changes nothing:
  Settings shows the plain reason, and the last file that could be used stays in effect, across restarts too (kept
  owner-only in `~/.noteling/team-settings.json`, for the same repository; unlinking deletes it). The file can't set
  `Host`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, `Connection`, `Transfer-Encoding` or `anthropic-version`, a header whose name
  isn't a header name, or one whose value has a line break, and Settings says so. Any other header is allowed,
  including a gateway's own auth headers. Two names that differ only in case are one header: the first is used.
- **What people see.** The Claude section of Settings shows one line (`Claude through llm-gateway.example.com · model
  claude-opus-5 · set by your team's tools`), says that everything sent to Claude goes to that host, and lists the
  headers sent by name, never their values. The fields the team sets show its values, greyed out ("Your team's tools
  set this. Unlink them to use your own."), and the API key field is hidden while a team gateway is set.

### Watch lists (`watch:` scripts)
Say "watch these items for me: 1, 2, 3" in chat and Noteling checks each item on a schedule, sending a Mac notification
when one is not as it should be **right now**. A watch is about now, not history: there is no change timeline, and an
earlier check is never evidence of a cause. What the person was last told is kept only so the same alert isn't
repeated. The site-specific part is a check script: the pack's, named in SKILL.md with `watch: <script>`, or the
watch's own `check.py`. Everything else is generic. Watches are a person's own, or their team's (see Team watches).

**One folder per watch.** Each of a person's watches is a folder in `~/.noteling/watches/`, named after the watch
(lowercase letters, digits and dashes, made unique), or any folder below it that holds a `watch.json` (folders may hold
other folders, like `holiday/oct/shoes`), so people can read a watch, edit it and hand it to a teammate the way they
do a tool pack:
- `watch.json` says what to watch. Noteling writes it, and people may edit it:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "6F1C2A3B-4D5E-4F60-8A7B-9C0D1E2F3A4B",
    "name": "Sale items",
    "check": "shop__watch_item",
    "items": [
      "123",
      {"key": "https://shop.example.com/item/456", "expect": {"price": 19.99}}
    ],
    "fields": ["price", "badges"],
    "expect": {"badges": "Deal"},
    "args": {"zip": "10001"},
    "every_minutes": 15,
    "paused": false,
    "starts": "2026-10-05T00:00:00-04:00",
    "ends": "2026-10-31T23:59:00-04:00",
    "created_at": "2026-10-03T14:00:00Z",
    "requires": ["SHOP_TOKEN"],
    "cards": "all",
    "files": ["problems", "all"]
  }
  ```
  Only `items` is required, and not even that when the folder has an items file. Each item is an id or page address,
  or an object with a `key` and its own `expect`. A missing `name` is the folder's path, a missing `check` the only pack
  check there is, and a missing `id` is made (and written down) the first time Noteling reads the file. `fields`,
  `args`, `starts` and `ends` are optional, `every_minutes` is held to 5–240, and keys Noteling doesn't use are kept when
  it writes the file. `cards` says when the watch has its card in Morning Files: left out (or `true`), while any item is
  red or grey; `"all"`, always; `false`, never (see Cards from watches). `files` says which files its card carries for
  Excel: left out, `["problems"]`; `["problems", "all"]`; or `[]`, none (see Files for Excel).
- `starts` and `ends` are ISO 8601 times, with an offset or without one (then they are the Mac's own time); a date alone
  means its midnight. Nothing is checked, and nobody is told, before `starts` or after `ends`; the window says "Starts
  Mon Oct 5, 12:00 AM" or "Ended …", and the chat tools' results say so too.
- `items.psv`, `items.csv` or `items.tsv`, when there is one, lists items and what counts as right for each (see Items
  files).
- `latest.json` says what the last run found, and only Noteling writes it: for each item, by its key, its title and
  address, what counts as right, what its first check that worked found (`captured`), its latest `state`, `facts` and
  `why`, what the check said counts as right (`check_expect`), when it was checked, its status and differences (or why
  it couldn't be checked), failures in a row, and what the person was last told. Keeping it apart from `watch.json`
  means a person editing one never collides with Noteling writing the other.
- `check.py`, when there is one, is the watch's own check (see below).

Noteling looks at the folders again at every tick and before each run (and before the chat answers about watches): a
`watch.json` or items file with a new modification date or size is read again, so items added or removed, `expect`,
`fields`, `paused`, `every_minutes`, `starts` and `ends` take effect at once. Items no check has looked at yet are
checked right away, and what counts as right is worked out again, so a value taken out of `expect` goes back to what
it was. A `watch.json` or items file that can't be read is never written over or deleted: the watch keeps its last good
definition, its row in Jobs and the chat show "Can't read watch.json: <reason>", and the log says so once,
until the file is fixed. A folder someone puts there is watched (a copy of another watch's folder becomes a watch of its own), a renamed
folder is the same watch, and a folder that is deleted stops its watch. Noteling watches up to 20 of a person's own
folders, oldest first. **Stop watching**, on the watch's page or with `stop_watch`, moves the folder to the macOS Trash, so
it can be put back; the page's **Show in Finder** opens it. On first launch with folders, an earlier single
`watch-list.json` is moved into them, with what each item's checks found and what the person was last told, and
renamed `watch-list.json.moved-<time>`.

**Team watches.** The team's tools (linked in Settings, see above) may hold watch jobs in a top-level `watches/` folder,
which is never loaded as a tool pack, in either tools folder: every folder below it that holds a `watch.json`, at any
depth, is a job. Its id is its path under `watches/` (`holiday/oct/fashion`), and its name is `name` from its
`watch.json`, else that path. Jobs are written by hand in the team's repository, each with a `watch.json`, often an
items file, and sometimes their own `check.py`.
- They are read-only: Noteling never writes into the team's copy, since every update replaces it. What a job finds is
  kept in `~/.noteling/team-watches/<id>/latest.json`, so it outlasts updates. `change_watch` refuses ("This job comes
  from your team's tools. Change it in the team repository."), and `stop_watch` turns it off.
- They are off until the person turns them on, with the switch on their row in Jobs (name, path, how many items
  "from your team's tools", how often, when it starts or ends) or with `turn_on_watch`; which ones are
  on is kept in `~/.noteling/team-watches/on.json`, owner-only. Only jobs that are on are checked and notify, up to 20
  at once. Turning one on checks it right away, and that first result says nothing: it shows where the person turned it
  on. Once on, its items and results show like a watch of their own, without Stop or Show in Finder.
- An update that changes a job's files is taken in at the next look, the same as a hand edit: every file in the new
  copy is new, so each is read again, and only a real change changes anything. A job that disappears in an update stops;
  what it found stays until the next launch, which deletes it and forgets that it was on.
- A job's own `check.py` runs from the team's copy, with the secrets its `watch.json` lists under `requires`.

**Items files.** A watch's folder may hold `items.psv`, `items.csv` or `items.tsv`, for a person's watch or a team's.
The delimiter comes from the name: `|` for .psv (or tabs, when its header row has no `|`), `,` for .csv, tab for .tsv;
a cell may be quoted with `"`. Only one is used: when there are several, the first of .psv, .tsv and .csv, and the
window and the chat say which. When there is one, the watch's items come from it, and any `items` in `watch.json` are
added to them, each once.
```
item|price|badge|in stock
123|$19.99|Deal|yes
456||Deal; Overall winner|
789|none|-|no
```
- The header row is required. Its first column is the item (an id or a page address). Each other header names a field
  of the check's `state`, matched without regard to case, with spaces, `-` and `_` the same (`In stock` is `in_stock`),
  and when it names no field but its plural does, that field (`badge` is `badges`). A column that matches nothing is
  said, plainly ("column colour isn't something the check reports"), in the window and the chat's results.
- Cells: empty says nothing about that field for that row; `none`, `null` or `-` expect none (null, or an empty list);
  a number, with or without a currency sign or thousands separators, is that number; `yes`, `no`, `true` and `false` are
  yes or no; values separated by `;` are a list; anything else is text.
- A row's cells are that item's own expectations, over the watch's `expect` (and over the item's own `expect` in
  `watch.json`). Rows with no item, or repeating one, are left out and listed ("row 7 has no item"). The file is read
  again whenever it changes.

**The check script.** Its `run(item: str, ...)` checks one item:
- `item` is the item exactly as the person gave it: an id or a page address. Extra arguments they gave when creating
  the watch (a zip code, say) are passed only if `run` declares them, as the declared type. `watch_items` refuses an
  argument the script doesn't take and asks for one it requires.
- It returns an object with `title` (string), an optional `url` (the page to open), `state`, and optionally `facts`,
  `why` and `expect`. `state` holds flat fields, each a string, number, bool, null or list of strings: the things worth
  watching, e.g. `{"seller": "Acme", "price": 12.33, "strikethrough": 13.95, "badges": ["Deal"], "in_stock": true}`.
  Report every field every time, with null when it has no value: a field missing from the first check that works isn't
  part of its snapshot. Up to 40 fields count, and a value that isn't flat is compared as its JSON text. `facts` is
  anything else that helps explain the item; up to 8,000 characters are kept.
- `expect` (field → value) is what counts as right for the item by default, e.g. `{"problems": 0, "in_stock": true}`:
  the weakest of what can say so (see What counts as right).
- `why` is the check's own reason, in its own words: a short string, or a list of them (up to five, each up to 300
  characters), e.g. "The page shows $24.99, but the price of record is $19.99 (set 10:32 AM). The page hasn't caught
  up." It shows in the notification after the difference lines (the first reason, in at most two lines, cut at a word),
  under the differences in the item's row on its watch's page, in the chat tools' results and in the explanation, as
  "What the check said". The model never writes it, and a check that couldn't check shows none, not an earlier one's.
- An `error` key, an exception, no `state` object, or running past 60 seconds means "couldn't check". The reason shown
  is the first line of the error, without the script's file name or the Python error type.
- It runs through the bundled uv like any pack script, with the Mac's proxy and certificates, the pack's `requires:`
  secrets and `NOTELING_CONTEXT` set to the item's page (app "Watch list", the item's address when known), and it stops
  when its watch is stopped.

```python
def run(item: str, zip: str = "") -> dict:
    """Check one item on the shop.

    Args:
        item: the item's id or its page address
        zip: delivery zip code
    """
    page = read_item(item, zip)   # the pack's own code
    return {"title": page["name"], "url": page["url"],
            "state": {"price": page["price"], "badges": page["badges"], "in_stock": page["in_stock"]},
            "facts": {"offers": page["offers"]},
            "expect": {"in_stock": True},   # optional: right by default
            "why": page.get("reason")}      # optional, in the check's own words
```

**A watch's own check.** A `check.py` in the watch's folder is used instead of the pack's script, with the same
contract. By default a watch uses the pack's check; its own is for what the pack's doesn't do, such as one call for a
whole list. It gets only the secrets its `watch.json` lists under `requires`, by the names packs use (so they are
entered in Settings for the pack that declares them), never Noteling's own token for the team's tools. It runs through
the same script runner as pack scripts, in its folder, with `NOTELING_TOOL_DIR` set to that folder, and writes no
bytecode cache there.

**List checks.** A check whose `run()` declares a parameter named `items` is called once per run with all the watch's
item keys, in order, plus the extra arguments it declares, instead of once per item. A watch with a list check holds up
to 200 items; one checked one item at a time holds 50 (items past the 50th are "couldn't check" and say so). It returns
either a list of per-item results in the same order, or an object of per-item results keyed by item; each follows the
contract above, `error` included:

```python
def run(items: list, zip: str = "") -> dict:
    found = read_items(items, zip)   # one call for all of them
    return {key: {"title": found[key]["name"], "state": {"price": found[key]["price"]}}
            for key in items if key in found}
```

An item the object has no result for is "couldn't check" ("The check returned nothing for this item.", naming keys it
returned that are no item); a list of another length can't be matched to the items, so every item is "couldn't check".
A run that fails (an `error` for the whole run, an exception) or takes longer than its time limit, a minute plus a
second per item and at most 10 minutes, is "couldn't check" for every item with the run's reason, which makes one
notification. A list run counts as one of the two checks that run at a time.

**What counts as right.** It depends on whether anything says so explicitly: an items file, the watch's `expect`, an
item's own `expect`, or a check's `expect`.
- When something does, only that counts, the strongest over the rest: the item's own (its row in the items file, over
  its `expect` in `watch.json`), then the watch's `expect`, then the check's. To that is added a snapshot of exactly the
  `fields` the watch names, if any, from the item's first check that worked. At the start of a sales event prices and
  badges change on purpose, so a snapshot of everything would turn every item red.
- When nothing does (a plain "watch these" from chat, with a check that says nothing), the first check that works is
  the snapshot: everything it reported, or only the `fields` named.
- An item whose first check fails gets its snapshot from its first later success; what is said explicitly counts at
  once. The chat's `expect` (in `watch_items` or `change_watch`) and hand edits to `watch.json` or the items file work
  it out again for every item and compare with what each item's latest check showed.

Names are matched to the check's fields as items file headers are (case, spaces, `-`, `_`, and plurals). Numbers are
equal within 0.005; text is trimmed, then exact; yes or no as such; null is a value of its own ("none"); and a number
or yes/no given as text ("12.33", "$12.33", "yes") counts as that number or answer. One text expected where the check
shows a list means the list includes it: a `badge` column of "Deal" means the item should show the Deal badge, and
other labels on the page don't count as wrong ("Badges: New — expected to include Deal"). A list expected of a list
means the same set (order doesn't matter, and an empty list is none), so a list captured from a first check keeps its
exact meaning. A field the check doesn't report is shown as not reported and never alerted on. A field the person
named that no item reports is called out in the `watch_items` result, with the fields the check does report, so a wrong
name never just stays green.

**When it notifies.** Never on an item's first check, since the chat shows it, never for a result the chat waited for
or for what counts as right changed in the chat, never for a team job that is off, and never before a watch's `starts`
or after its `ends`. Otherwise it notifies when an item goes from as expected to not as expected, when it is not as
expected in another way than last told, when it is back to as expected ("Back to what you expected"), and when it
couldn't be checked twice in a row ("Couldn't check: <reason>", once until a check works again). After a hand edit to
what counts as right, the next check tells them. Three or more items of one watch that couldn't be checked for the same
reason in one run make one notification ("Couldn't check 12 items: <reason>"). The title is the item's title, the
subtitle the watch's name, and the body plain words: one line per difference, e.g. "Price: 24.99 — expected 19.99",
then the check's `why`. Clicking it opens the chat on why the item is red or grey, or else the watch's page in Morning
Files (Jobs, when the watch is gone).
Notifications use UserNotifications and work only from the `.app` bundle; elsewhere (`swift run`, tests) alerts go to
the log. macOS asks for permission when the first watch is created or a team job turned on; without it everything else
works and the chat says they are off.

**Schedule.** Every 15 minutes by default (5 to 240; team jobs often every one or two hours). The runner ticks every 30
seconds, and 10 seconds after the Mac wakes. It starts the watches that are due (on, not paused, and between their
`starts` and `ends`), runs at most two checks at a time across all watches, and never runs one watch twice at once. It
starts once the packs have loaded.

**Chat tools** (`WatchListConversation`, in every general chat turn; a watch is named by its name, its id or path, or
the end of a path that only one has, like "fashion"):
- `watch_items` {items, name?, every_minutes?, fields?, expect?, args?, check?} creates a watch of the person's own and
  checks every item at once. It waits up to 90 seconds, then returns per item its title, status, what it shows now,
  what counts as right and the check's `why`, and the watch's folder. `check` picks a pack when several have a `watch:`
  script; with none, the chat says to link the team's tools in Settings.
- `list_watches` (the person's own, then `team_watches` with whether each is on, and folders it can't watch),
  `check_watch_now` {watch?}, `change_watch` {watch, add_items?, remove_items?, every_minutes?, expect?, paused?},
  `turn_on_watch` {watch} and `turn_off_watch` {watch} (a team job on or off; one of the person's own resumed or
  paused), and `stop_watch` {watch}. A change leaves a receipt on the pad and an Open Jobs tab; a watch whose files
  can't be read says so, and isn't changed until they're fixed. Results include when a watch starts or ends, its items
  file, rows it left out and columns the check doesn't report.

**Why?** `Assistant.explainWatched` sends what counts as right, what the latest check shows and when, what the check
said, and its facts. The request is about the item's page (a synthetic context: app "Watch list", the item's address),
so that page's pack and its scripts are available, and it never takes control. The answer comes as **Why**, **What you
can do** and, only when something couldn't be confirmed, **Couldn't check**.

**Files.** A person's watches: `~/.noteling/watches/<path>/watch.json`, an optional items file and `check.py`, and
`latest.json` (folders 0700, files Noteling writes 0600, each written whole and moved into place). Team watches: read
from the team's copy, with `~/.noteling/team-watches/<id>/latest.json` and `~/.noteling/team-watches/on.json`. The code is
in `Sources/Familiar/Features/WatchList/` (`WatchListFiles` for the files, `WatchListPages` for the pages).

**Files for Excel.** A run over a long list can't be read on a card, so a watch's card carries the run's full results
as CSV files, which open where people already work, such as Excel (⌘F, filters, tabs). `files` in `watch.json` says
which (`WatchListExport`):
- `problems.csv` (`["problems"]`, the default): every item not as expected or that couldn't be checked, those not as
  expected first, each in the watch's order;
- `all.csv` (`["problems", "all"]`, or `["all"]`): every item, as expected too, in the watch's order;
- `[]`: none. A kind with no items has no file.

One row per item, with these columns:

| Column | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `item` | the item as given: an id or a page address |
| `title`, `url` | the check's title, and the page to open |
| `status` | `as expected`, `not as expected`, `couldn't check` or `not checked yet` |
| `symptoms` | the fields that differ, joined with "; " |
| one per field the check reports, named as it names it | what the item shows now; empty while it couldn't check, since an earlier check's values are never shown |
| `expected <field>`, one per field that counts | what counts as right |
| `why` | the check's own `why` lines joined with " / ", or why it couldn't check |
| `checked_at` | when, in this Mac's time: `2026-10-05 18:31:05` |
| `check` | which check ran |

The fields the watch names in `fields` come first, then the rest alphabetically. Numbers are written as the check wrote
them (19.99, never 19.989999999999998), yes or no as `yes` and `no`, a list joined with "; ", and none as `none`. The
files follow RFC 4180 (a cell holding a comma, a quote or a line break is quoted, its quotes doubled), in UTF-8 with a
byte order mark so Excel reads every language, lines ending in CRLF; a text that starts the way a formula does (`=`,
`+`, `-`, `@`) gets a `'` in front, so it shows as written and never runs. Excel opens at most 1,048,576 rows, so a
file of more than 1,048,575 items is split into `all-1.csv`, `all-2.csv`… (`problems-1.csv`…), and the card says so
under its summary line: "All results are in 2 files: Excel opens at most 1,048,576 rows per file." Noteling writes them
at the end of each run into the watch's folder of the cards inbox, before `job.json`, which lists them, so they reach
the card like any inbox card's files (see The cards inbox), and the card keeps only the latest run's. When only they
change, `job.json` is written again as it was, so the card takes them. With `"cards": false` there is no card and there
are no files; a run with nothing wrong deletes them with `job.json`, and the resolved card keeps the copies it has.

**Watches among the jobs.** The watches live in the Morning panel, in Jobs with the reading jobs, not in a window of
their own: to a person a watch is the same kind of thing as a source (it runs, has results, and makes a card in Morning
Files). See Jobs, under Morning Files above, for the list and the header every job's page shares.
- **In Jobs** (`MorningNavigation.Route.jobs`; the older `.watches` route shows it too) a watch's row shows its name
  (and a team job's path), what it checks ("Checks 3 items", "· from your team's tools"), how often it runs and when it
  starts or ends, its last run and how its items stand ("Last run 6:31 PM · 2 of 8 not as expected · 1 couldn't check",
  "Not run yet"), how it stands ("Running", "Paused", "Paused in the team's tools", "Off", "Needs Settings" when its
  check lacks a secret, "Failed" when nothing could be checked), with **Run now**, which checks it now, and **Pause**/
  **Resume**, or a team job's on/off switch. A watch.json or items file that can't be read, the items file's notes (rows
  left out, columns the check doesn't report, several items files) and folders past the limits show on their rows. The
  team's jobs come after the person's own, under "From your team's tools. Turn on the ones that are yours: only those
  run and tell you." With nothing at all, Jobs says how to start a job, including watching items in chat, and that the
  team's jobs show there once its tools are linked.
- **A watch's page** (`.watch(id)`), opened from its row, from its card's **Open job**, from its cards folder, and from
  a notification about an item that is back to as expected: the jobs' header (its name, what it checks and how often,
  its last run, Run now, Pause or the on/off switch, and **Card**, its job.json card); for a watch of the person's own
  **Show in Finder** and **Stop watching…** (which asks first); what's wrong with its files; **Cards folder (n)**, to
  its card's folder, with any cards its check wrote itself; and every item with its dot, what it shows, what the check
  said, when it was checked, and **Why?** and **Open page**. Back goes to Jobs, or to the folder it was opened from.
- **A watch's cards folder** starts with "Checked 6:31 PM · every 15 minutes · Run now · Open job"; other folders don't.
- Opening the panel on Jobs or a watch's page from the menu bar or a notification isn't recorded by the attention test,
  which is about looks at the cards; the chat's Open Jobs tab is recorded as a chat open. The panel is 650 points wide on
  every screen, the jobs' too, and hides from screen sharing as it always has.

### The cards inbox (`cards/inbox/`)
A script makes a card in Morning Files by writing a file, with no model involved: one JSON file per card,
`~/.noteling/cards/inbox/<source>/<id>.json`.
```json
{
  "title": "Refund ready · Order 123",
  "body": "The price dropped by $10 after you paid.",
  "url": "https://shop.example.com/order/123",
  "severity": "high",
  "actions": [
    {"label": "Open order", "url": "https://shop.example.com/order/123"},
    {"label": "Worth it?", "ask": "Is this refund worth claiming?"}
  ],
  "details": {"paid": 22.0, "now": 12.0},
  "files": ["refunds.csv", "receipt.pdf"]
}
```
- Only `title` is required (up to 200 characters). `body` is shown in full (up to 8,000), `url` must be an http or https
  address, `severity` is `high`, `normal` (the default) or `low`, and `details`, text or any JSON (up to 8,000
  characters), shows under **Show original** and goes with the card when it is discussed. Keys it doesn't know are
  ignored.
- `actions` (up to six) only open a web page (`url`), ask Noteling about the card in chat (`ask`), or open a watch's
  page in Jobs (`watch`, the watch's id; the button shows only while there is such a watch); anything else is
  dropped. A card from the inbox never runs anything: `MorningStore.enqueue` refuses it, a card discussion can't change
  its options, and it has no Edit. A card with a `url` and no button that opens a page gets **Open page**.
- `parts` (up to 1,000 strings) says what the matter is made of, such as which items are wrong. A card the person
  resolved stays resolved while its file stays, however it changes, until it names a part it didn't have when they
  resolved it; then it opens again. Without `parts`, nothing a file says while it stays opens it.
- `files` (up to 10) names files the script wrote beside the card file, in the same folder, such as the full results of
  a run for Excel: plain names only, never a path, so nothing outside that folder is ever taken. When Noteling reads a
  new version of the card file, it copies them into its own folder, `cards/files/<card id>/`, in place of the card's
  earlier ones, all at once: a card keeps only its latest files, and the script may change or delete its own afterwards
  without breaking the card. The same card file read again (at the next launch, say) keeps them as they are, so write
  the files first, then the card file, and write the card file again when they change. Each may be up to 500 MB, and
  only tables, text, PDFs and pictures are taken: csv, tsv, txt, json, md, log, xlsx, pdf, png, jpg, jpeg, gif and heic;
  never anything that can run, such as an app, a command, a script, an installer, a disk image, a web page, an SVG or an
  archive. A listed file that is missing, too big, of another kind, a link, hidden or past the tenth isn't attached,
  and the card says why, one plain note each: "problems.csv wasn't attached: it's 620 MB, and the most is 500 MB."
  Nothing else changes: the card is still a card, with the files that could be attached. The copies keep their
  modification times and can only be read, so a change made in Excel is saved somewhere else rather than lost at the
  next run. The card stores each file's name, size and modification time; its **Files** section lists them with their
  size, and **Open** (in the file's default app), **Save as…** and **Show in Finder**, and its tile on the folder page
  shows a paperclip and how many.
- **Identity** is `<source>/<id>`: the folder, and the file's name without `.json`. Writing the file again changes the
  same card's title, body, page, severity, buttons, details and files, and nothing the person did: their decision, their
  context, the folder's name.
- **Deleting the file** means the matter went away. A card nobody had decided anything about is resolved; a card the
  person took keeps their decision and says "Its script no longer reports this". Either way it keeps its files. A file
  that comes back is the matter again: a resolved card opens again, whoever resolved it, and a card the person took
  keeps their decision.
- A file that can't be read (not JSON, no title, bigger than 64 KB) is never deleted and never resolves its card: the log
  says why once, and its source's folder in Morning Files lists it until it is fixed. A source shows up to 500 cards and
  up to 100 sources are read; files past that are listed, and their cards stay as they are.
- Each source is a folder in Morning Files, named after its watch for a watch's cards and otherwise after the folder
  (`pack-shop`). A folder the person renames keeps its name.
- Noteling looks at the inbox at launch, at the watch list's 30-second tick and right after a watch writes cards. It
  reads only files that changed, saves only when a card changed, and never writes or deletes a script's files, including
  those a card carries and those it doesn't list.
- The card step, its reconciliation and the attention test never touch or count these cards: they only consider the
  cards they track, and the count of cards to review that the attention test records leaves them out.

**`NOTELING_CARDS_DIR`.** Every script gets a folder of its own in the inbox, made when needed and readable only by the
person: a pack's scripts `cards/inbox/pack-<pack folder>/`, a watch's check `cards/inbox/watch-<its path, / as ->/`
(`watch-team-<path>/` for a team's job). The name keeps only letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, so it is always one
folder directly in the inbox and never another source's. Write the whole file at once, so Noteling never reads half of
it, and delete it when the matter is over:
```python
import json, os
card = {"title": "Refund ready · Order 123", "body": "The price dropped by $10 after you paid.", "url": "https://shop.example.com/order/123"}
path = os.path.join(os.environ["NOTELING_CARDS_DIR"], "order-123.json")   # this script's own folder in the inbox
with open(path + ".tmp", "w") as f: json.dump(card, f)
os.replace(path + ".tmp", path)   # the whole file at once, so Noteling never reads half of it
```
A card that carries a file names it under `files`. Write the file the same way, before the card file:
```python
import csv, json, os
folder = os.environ["NOTELING_CARDS_DIR"]
with open(os.path.join(folder, "refunds.csv.tmp"), "w", newline="", encoding="utf-8-sig") as f:   # utf-8-sig: Excel reads every language
    csv.writer(f).writerows([["order", "refund"], ["123", "10.00"], ["124", "4.50"]])
os.replace(os.path.join(folder, "refunds.csv.tmp"), os.path.join(folder, "refunds.csv"))   # the file first
with open(os.path.join(folder, "refunds.json.tmp"), "w") as f: json.dump({"title": "2 refunds ready", "files": ["refunds.csv"]}, f)
os.replace(os.path.join(folder, "refunds.json.tmp"), os.path.join(folder, "refunds.json"))   # then the card that lists it
```

**Cards from watches.** On by default, each watch has one card, however long its list: `cards/inbox/watch-<path>/job.json`,
written by Noteling (`WatchListCards`) at the end of each run, when what the run found changed, with what it found as it
found it, and no model. A run with nothing wrong deletes it, so the card resolves; problems in a later run write it
again, and the same card opens again, even one the person resolved. If they resolved it while items were still wrong,
it stays resolved through runs that find the same items wrong, until one finds an item wrong that wasn't when they
resolved it (the file's `parts` are its wrong items), or everything is fine and something goes wrong again. A watch being
checked keeps its card as it was until its run ends. `"cards": "all"` keeps the card always, `"cards": false` gives
none, and a team job that's off has none: turning it off deletes its file, as do a watch that's gone and one whose
cards are turned off, at launch, at each tick and after each run.
- Title: "Sale items: 2 of 8 not as expected · 6:31 PM"; with only items it couldn't check, "Sale items: couldn't check
  1 of 8 · 6:31 PM"; with `"all"` and nothing wrong, "Sale items: all 8 as expected · 6:31 PM". Severity `high` with
  anything not as expected, `normal` with only couldn't-check, `low` otherwise.
- Body: a summary line, "2 not as expected · 1 couldn't check · 5 as expected · checked 6:31 PM by <check>", then each
  wrong item, those not as expected first, then those it couldn't check: its title (and key), its difference lines
  exactly as the notification writes them and the check's `why` as it said it, or "Couldn't check: <reason>". With
  `"all"`, every other item follows in one line ("Blue kettle (123): As expected"). Up to 50 items, within the 8,000
  characters the inbox shows of a body; the rest are counted: "…and 150 more. Open the job to see them all."
- `details` are the facts of the items it lists (up to 8,000 characters). The buttons are **Open job** (the watch's page)
  and **Why?**, which asks the chat "Why are items in Sale items not as expected right now?" in general chat, where
  `list_watches` has the details; nothing of the screen goes with it.
- `files`: the CSV files its watch's `files` name, written beside `job.json` before it (see Files for Excel), so the
  whole list is a click away however long it is.
- Earlier versions wrote one file per item (`item-…json`); they are deleted at launch, so their cards resolve. Noteling's
  files in a watch's folder are `job.json`, `problems.csv` and `all.csv` (and their numbered parts): a check may write
  cards and files of its own beside them under other names, and those are left alone.

The code is in `Sources/Familiar/Features/Morning/CardInbox.swift` (with `CardFiles.swift` for the files a card carries
and `CardFilesView.swift` for its Files section) and `Features/WatchList/WatchListCards.swift` (with
`WatchListExport.swift` for the CSV files).

## Dev notes
- macOS binds permission grants to the app's code signature. Ad-hoc builds change every time, so run
  `scripts/make-dev-cert.sh` once; the build script signs with the `Noteling Dev` identity it creates and grants persist.
  For other people's Macs this is replaced by an Apple Developer ID plus notarization (see Distribution below).

## Distribution (Apple Developer account)
One-time: install a **Developer ID Application** certificate (Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → Request a
Certificate From a Certificate Authority, upload the request on the developer portal, install the .cer), and store a
notarization credential: `xcrun notarytool store-credentials familiar-notary --apple-id EMAIL --team-id TEAMID --password APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`.
Then `./scripts/release.sh` signs with the hardened runtime, notarizes, staples, and writes `dist/<version>/Noteling-<version>.dmg`
and `.pkg` (signed too if a **Developer ID Installer** certificate exists).
The release script refuses an existing output directory; use a new version instead of replacing an earlier build.
`scripts/build.sh` picks the Developer ID
automatically when present; Developer ID builds keep secrets in the Keychain (`secretsStore: auto`).
IT can push the .pkg via MDM with a PPPC profile that pre-approves Accessibility; Screen Recording cannot be
pre-approved, so the user clicks one prompt on first launch, once per install.
- Source layout:
  - `Sources/FamiliarContracts`: shared conversation/tool interfaces and results.
  - `Sources/FamiliarRuntime`: API/CLI providers, conversation history, execution lifecycle, tool routing, and process helpers; no app/native imports.
  - `Sources/Familiar/App`: composition, desktop activity ownership, shell state, app entry point, and headless/render commands.
  - `Sources/Familiar/Features`: Chat, WatchLearn, ContextNotes, Companion, and Settings. Each workflow keeps its own state; chat presents Watch events without owning recordings.
    - `Features/Calendar`: sources and jobs (calendar, mail and web profiles in `CalendarStore`), screen reads (`SourceCollectionTask`) and script reads (`ScriptReading`, `ScriptReadWindow`), the run archive (`SourceRunStore`), chat's job tools (`SourceConversation`), the Latest run and Run history screens, the editors, and the older Manage sources screen. `App/CalendarCollectionRunner` runs the reads.
    - `Features/Jobs`: the jobs as one list: their words, statuses and order and the cards each made (`Jobs`), the Jobs page and the home's Jobs box (`JobsPage`, `JobsEntry`), the header and buttons every job's page shares (`JobHeader`, `JobControls`, `JobCardLink`), and a reading job's page (`SourceJobPage`). A watch's page is `WatchJobPage`, in `Features/WatchList`.
    - `Features/Morning`: cards, Who's Who and queued work in `morning.sqlite` (`MorningStore`), the card step and its judgments (`CardGenerationService`, `CardGenerationSubmission`), reconciliation with continuing cards, card discussions, and the Morning Files screens.
    - `Features/Attention`: the one-week attention test: its append-only ledger in `attention/`, labels from thumbs, explanations and card actions, the numbers, and the thumbs, daily line, rest and week screens.
    - `Features/BackgroundTasks`: `BackgroundTaskStore`, the task screen's state: the running task and up to 20 recent results with their last frame.
  - `Sources/Familiar/Native`: Accessibility context/hit testing, screen capture, control mechanics, and permissions/hotkeys.
  - `Sources/Familiar/Presentation`: shared shell surfaces and execution preview; `Configuration`, `ToolPacks`, and `Knowledge` retain current settings, pack storage, and context assembly.
- Cleanup goals and integration boundaries: [architecture plan](../architecture/next-phase-structure.md).
- Python helpers in `Resources/py/`: `introspect.py` (ast-only schema extraction), `run_tool.py` (executes `run(**args)`), `claude_mcp.py` (private CLI tool bridge).
